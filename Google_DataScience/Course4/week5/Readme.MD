# Glossary terms from week 5

### Terms and definitions from Course 4, Week 5

**Alternative hypothesis:** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis and is accepted as true only if there is convincing evidence for it										

**Hypothesis testing:** A statistical procedure that uses sample data to evaluate an assumption about a population parameter										

**Null hypothesis:** A statement that is assumed to be true unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary										

**One-sample test:** A hypothesis test that determines whether or not a population parameter like a mean or proportion is equal to a specific value																			

**One-tailed test:** In a hypothesis test, results when the alternative hypothesis states that the actual value of a population parameter is either less than or greater than the value in the null hypothesis

**P-value:** The probability of observing results as or more extreme than those observed when the null hypothesis is true									

**Significance level:** The threshold at which a result is considered statistically significant										

**Statistical significance:** The claim that the results of a test or experiment are not explainable by chance alone										

**Test statistic:** A value that shows how closely the observed data matches the distribution expected under the null hypothesis										

**Two-sample test:** A hypothesis test that determines whether or not two population parameters such as two means or two proportions are equal to each other										

**Two-tailed test:** In a hypothesis test, results when the alternative hypothesis states that the actual value of the parameter does not equal the value in the null hypothesis

**Type I error (false positive):** The rejection of a null hypothesis that is actually true										

**Type II error (false negative):** The failure to reject a null hypothesis which is actually false										

**Z-score:** A measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a data point is
