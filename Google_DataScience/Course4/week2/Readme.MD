# Glossary terms from week 2

### Terms and definitions from Course 4, Week 2

**Addition rule (for mutually exclusive events):** The concept that if the events A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability of A or B happening is the sum of the probabilities of A and B									

**Bayes' theorem:** A math formula for stating that for any two events A and B, the probability of A given B equals the probability of A multiplied by the probability of B given A divided by the probability of B; Also referred to as Bayes’ rule					

**Bayes’ rule:** (Refer to Bayes’ theorem)									

**Bayesian inference:** (Refer to Bayesian statistics)									

**Bayesian statistics:** A powerful method for analyzing and interpreting data in modern data analytics; Also referred to as Bayesian inference									

**Binomial distribution:** A discrete distribution that models the probability of events with only two possible outcomes: success or failure									

**Classical probability:** A type of probability based on formal reasoning about events with equally likely outcomes							

**Complement of an event:** In statistics, refers to an event not occurring									

**Complement rule:** A concept stating that the probability that event A does not occur is one minus the probability of A							

**Conditional probability:** Refers to the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred									

**Continuous random variable:** A variable that takes all the possible values in some range of numbers									

**Dependent events:** The concept that two events are dependent if one event changes the probability of the other event									

**Discrete random variable:** A variable that has a countable number of possible values									

**Empirical probability:** A type of probability based on experimental or historical data									

**Empirical rule:** A concept stating that the values on a normal curve are distributed in a regular pattern, based on their distance from the mean	

**False positive:** A test result that indicates something is present when it really is not									

**Independent events:** The concept that two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not change the probability of the other event									

**Multiplication rule (for independent events):** The concept that if the events A and B are independent, then the probability of both A and B happening is the probability of A multiplied by the probability of B																

**Mutually exclusive:** The concept that two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time								

**Normal distribution:** A continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean and bell-shaped								

**Objective probability:** A type of probability based on statistics, experiments, and mathematical measurements								

**Poisson distribution:** A probability distribution that models the probability that a certain number of events will occur during a specific time period								

**Posterior probability:** Refers to the updated probability of an event based on new data									

**Prior probability:** Refers to the probability of an event before new data is collected									

**Probability:** The branch of mathematics that deals with measuring and quantifying uncertainty									

**Probability distribution:** A function that describes the likelihood of the possible outcomes of a random event											

**Random experiment:** A process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty									

**Random variable:** A variable that represents the values for the possible outcomes of a random event									

**Sample space:** The set of all possible values for a random variable									

**Standard deviation:** A statistic that calculates the typical distance of a data point from the mean of a dataset							

**Standardization:** The process of putting different variables on the same scale									

**Subjective probability:** A type of probability based on personal feelings, experience, or judgment																

**Z-score:** A measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a data point is
