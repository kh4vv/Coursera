**Confidence level:** A measure that expresses the uncertainty of the estimation process															

**Interval:** A sample statistic plus or minus the margin of error		

**Interval estimate:** A calculation that uses a range of values to estimate a population parameter												

**Lower limit:** When constructing an interval, the calculation of the sample means minus the margin of error														

**Margin of error:** The maximum expected difference between a population parameter and a sample estimate														

**Method:** A function that defines and performs behaviors like computation														

**Point estimate:** A calculation that uses a single value to estimate a population parameter														

**Standard error of the mean:** The sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size
