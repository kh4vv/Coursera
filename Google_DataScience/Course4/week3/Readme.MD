# Glossary terms from week 3

### Terms and definitions from Course 4, Week 3

**Central Limit Theorem:** The idea that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases															

**Cluster random sample:** A probability sampling method that divides a population into clusters, randomly selects certain clusters, and includes all members from the chosen clusters in the sample															

**Convenience sample:** A non-probability sampling method that involves choosing members of a population that are easy to contact or reach															

**Descriptive statistics:** A type of statistics that summarizes the main features of a dataset														

**Inferential statistics:** A type of statistics that uses sample data to draw conclusions about a larger population															

**Non-probability sampling:** A sampling method that is based on convenience or the personal preferences of the researcher, rather than random selection															

**Nonresponse bias:** Refers to when certain groups of people are less likely to provide responses															

**Point estimate:** A calculation that uses a single value to estimate a population parameter														

**Population:** Every possible element that someone is interested in measuring

**Population proportion:** The percentage of individuals or elements in a population that share a certain characteristic															

**Probability sampling:** A sampling method that uses random selection to generate a sample														

**Purposive sample:** A non-probability sampling method that involves researchers selecting participants based on the purpose of their study															

**Random seed:** A starting point for generating random numbers															

**Representative sample:** A sample that accurately reflects the characteristics of a population														

**Sample:** A subset of a population

**Sample size:** The number of individuals or items chosen for a study or experiment															

**Sampling:** The process of selecting a subset of data from a population	

**Sampling bias:** Refers to when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole	

**Sampling distribution:** A probability distribution of a sample statistic															

**Sampling frame:** A list of all the items in a target population															

**Sampling variability:** Refers to how much an estimate varies between samples															

**Sampling with replacement:** Refers to when a population element can be selected more than one time															

**Sampling without replacement:** Refers to when a population element can be selected only one time																									

**Simple random sample:** A probability sampling method in which every member of a population is selected randomly and has an equal chance of being chosen															

**Snowball sample:** A method of non-probability sampling that involves researchers recruiting initial participants to be in a study and then asking them to recruit other people to participate in the study															

**Standard error:** The standard deviation of a sample statistic		

**Standard error of the mean:** The sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size																											

**Stratified random sample:** A probability sampling method that divides a population into groups and randomly selects some members from each group to be in the sample															

**Systematic random sample:** A probability sampling method that puts every member of a population into an ordered sequence, chooses a random starting point in the sequence, and selects members for the sample at regular intervals															

**Target population:** The complete set of elements that someone is interested in knowing more about															

**Undercoverage bias:** Refers to when some members of a population are inadequately represented in a sample															

**Voluntary response sample:** A method of non-probability sampling that consists of members of a population who volunteer to participate in a study
