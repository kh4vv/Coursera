# Glossary terms from week 1

### Terms and definitions from Course 5, Week 1

**Absolute values:** (Refer to observed values)

**Causation:** A cause-and-effect relationship where one variable directly causes the other to change in a particular way										

**Dependent variable (Y):** The variable a given model estimates					

**Explanatory variable:** (Refer to independent variable)

**Independent variable (X):** A variable whose trends are associated with the dependent variable		

**Intercept (constant ùêµ0):** The y value of the point on the regression line where it intersects with the y-axis	

**Line:** A collection of an infinite number of points extending in two opposite directions		

**Linear regression:** A technique that estimates the linear relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables					

**Link function:** A nonlinear function that connects or links the dependent variable to the independent variables mathematically								

**Logistic regression:** A technique that models a categorical dependent variable based on one or more independent variables									

**Loss function:** A function that measures the distance between the observed values and the model‚Äôs estimated values										

**Model assumptions:** Statements about the data that must be true to justify the use of a particular modeling technique								

**Negative correlation:** An inverse relationship between two variables, where when one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease, and vice versa				

**Observed values:** The existing sample of data, where each data point in the sample is represented by an observed value of the dependent variable and an observed value of the independent variable											

**Outcome variable:** (Refer to dependent variable)

**Positive correlation:** A relationship between two variables that tend to increase or decrease together												

**Predictor variable:** (Refer to independent variable)

**Regression analysis:** A group of statistical techniques that use existing data to estimate the relationships between a single dependent variable and one or more independent variables	

**Regression coefficient:** The estimated betas in a regression model		

**Regression models:** (Refer to regression analysis)

**Response variable:** (Refer to dependent variable)						

**Slope:** The amount that y increases or decreases per one-unit increase of x
