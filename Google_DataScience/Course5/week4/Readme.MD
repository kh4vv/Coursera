### Terms and definitions from Course 5, Week 4		

**Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):** A group of statistical techniques that test the difference of means between three or more groups

**ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance):** A statistical technique that tests the difference of means between three or more groups while controlling for the effects of covariates, or variable(s) irrelevant to the test

**Chi-squared (χ²) Goodness of Fit Test:** A hypothesis test that determines whether an observed categorical variable follows an expected distribution			

**Chi-squared (χ²) Test for Independence:** A hypothesis test that determines whether or not two categorical variables are associated with each other

**Hypothesis testing:** A statistical procedure that uses sample data to evaluate an assumption about a population parameter

**One-Way ANOVA:** A type of statistical testing that compares the means of one continuous dependent variable based on three or more groups of one categorical variable

**MANCOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Covariance):** An extension of ANCOVA and MANOVA that compares how two or more continuous outcome variables vary according to categorical independent variables, while controlling for covariates	

**MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance):** An extension of ANOVA that compares how two or more continuous outcome variables vary according to categorical independent variables

**Post hoc test:** An ANOVA test that performs a pairwise comparison between all available groups while controlling for the error rate

**Two-Way ANOVA:** A type of statistical testing that compares the means of one continuous dependent variable based on three or more groups of two categorical variables
