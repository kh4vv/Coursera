### Terms and definitions from Course 5, Week 5

**Accuracy:** Refers to the proportion of data points that were correctly categorized	

**Binomial logistic regression:** A technique that models the probability of an observation falling into one of two categories, based on one or more independent variables

**Binomial logistic regression linearity assumption:** An assumption stating that there should be a linear relationship between each X variable and the logit of the probability that Y equals one

**Confusion matrix:** A graphical representation of how accurate a classifier is at predicting the labels for a categorical variable

**Likelihood:** The probability of observing the actual data, given some set of beta parameters

**Logistic regression:** A technique that models a categorical dependent variable (Y) based on one or more independent variables (X)

**Log-odds function:** (Refer to logit)

**Logit:** The logarithm of the odds of a given probability

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** A technique for estimating the beta parameters that maximize the likelihood of the model producing the observed data

**Precision:** The proportion of positive predictions that were true positives

**Recall:** The proportion of positives the model was able to identify correctly
