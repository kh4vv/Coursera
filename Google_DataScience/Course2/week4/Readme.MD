### Terms and definitions from Course 2, Week 4

**agg():** A pandas groupby method that allows the user to apply multiple calculations to groups of data

**Aliasing:** A process that allows the user to assign an alternate name—or alias—to something

**append():** A method that adds an element to the end of a list

**Boolean masking:** A filtering technique that overlays a Boolean grid onto a dataframe in order to select only the values in the dataframe that align with the True values of the grid

**concat():** A pandas function that combines data either by adding it horizontally as new columns for existing rows or vertically as new rows for existing columns

**CSV file:** A plaintext file that uses commas to separate distinct values from one another; Stands for "comma-separated values”

**Data structure:** A collection of data values or objects that contain different data types

**DataFrame:** A two-dimensional, labeled data structure with rows and columns

**dict():** A function used to create a dictionary

**Dictionary:** A data structure that consists of a collection of key-value pairs

**difference():** A function that finds the elements present in one set but not the other

**dtype:** A NumPy attribute used to check the data type of the contents of an array

**Global variable:** A variable that can be accessed from anywhere in a program or script

**groupby():** A pandas DataFrame method that groups rows of the dataframe together based on their values at one or more columns, which allows further analysis of the groups

**iloc[]:** A type of notation in pandas that indicates when the user wants to select by integer-location-based position

**Immutability:** The concept that a data structure or element’s values can never be altered or updated

**Import statement:** A statement that uses the import keyword to load an external library, package, module, or function into the computing environment

**Inner join:** A way of combining data such that only the keys that are in both dataframes get included in the merge

**insert():** A function that takes an index as the first parameter and an element as the second parameter, then inserts the element into a list at the given index

**intersection():** A function that finds the elements that two sets have in common

**items():** A dictionary method to retrieve both the dictionary’s keys and values

**Keys:** The shared points of reference between different dataframes

**keys():** A dictionary method to retrieve only the dictionary’s keys

**Left join:** A way of combining data such that all of the keys in the left dataframe are included, even if they aren’t in the right dataframe

**Library:** A reusable collection of code; also referred to as a “package”

**List:** A data structure that helps store and manipulate an ordered collection of items

**List comprehension:** Formulaic creation of a new list based on the values in an existing list

**loc[]:** Notation that is used to select pandas rows and columns by name

**matplotlib:** A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python

**merge():** A pandas function that joins two dataframes together; it only combines data by extending along axis one horizontally

**Module:** A simple Python file containing a collection of functions and global variables 

**Mutability:** The ability to change the internal state of a data structure

**N-dimensional array:** The core data object of NumPy; also referred to as “ndarray”

**NaN:** How null values are represented in pandas; stands for “not a number”

**ndim:** A NumPy attribute used to check the number of dimensions of an array

**Nested loop:** A loop inside of another loop

**NumPy:** An essential library that contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures and functions to manipulate them

**Outer join:** A way of combining data such that all of the keys from both dataframes get included in the merge

**pandas:** A powerful library built on top of NumPy that’s used to manipulate and analyze tabular data

**pop():** A method that extracts an element from a list by removing it at a given index

**remove():** A method that removes an element from a list

**reshape():** A NumPy method used to change the shape of an array

**Right join:** A way of combining data such that all the keys in the right dataframe are included—even if they aren’t in the left dataframe

**Seaborn:** A visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a simpler interface for working with common plots and graphs

**Sequence:** A positionally ordered collection of items

**Series:** A one-dimensional, labeled array where the data type must be the same for all the data in a given series

**Set:** A data structure in Python that contains only unordered, non-interchangeable elements

**set():** A function that takes an iterable as an argument and returns a new set object

**shape:** A NumPy attribute used to check the shape of an array

**symmetric_difference():** A function that finds elements from both sets that are mutually not present in the other

**Tabular data:** Data that is in the form of a table, with rows and columns 

**Tuple:** An immutable sequence that can contain elements of any data type

**tuple():** A function that transforms input into tuples

**type():** A function used to identify the type of data in a list

**union():** A function that finds all the elements from both sets

**values():** A dictionary method to retrieve only the dictionary’s values

**Vectorization:** A process that enables operations to be performed on multiple components of a data object at the same time
